Aggie Game Jammers project for Desert Bus For Hope Game Jam 2016
Desert Bus Vegas 100
You've arrived in Las Vegas, now it's time to do what you came for.

You've suffered a few bug splats, and maybe a tow back to Tucson, but you made it through the drive. Now it's time to drive even more.
Welcome to the Desert Bus Vegas 100, a secret race for only the most dedicated Desert Bus drivers.
Unfortunately, it seems like you're the only one who made it. Don't read too much into that.

Made for the Desert Bus for Hope 10 Game Jam!
